# Contributing-Guidelines

If you would like to contribute with a link to the current week issue:

* Should follow this format: **\<Title of the Article\>**, by **\<Name of the Author\>**
* Shouldn't be more than 2 weeks old (although exception can be made: e.g. Tools/Libraries).
* Should fit in one of the categories:
 * **Articles** - Generally speaking these are technical articles. They should expose the reader to code, but it's not mandatory.
 * **Tools/Libraries**- Links to tools or libraries related to iOS development. Could range from tools like Sketch (because in one way or another is used while developing iOS apps) to [fastlane](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane), passing by Trending Github repos (Objective-c, Swift, Objective-c++, etc). These don't strictly follow the 2 weeks old rule.
 * **UI/UX** - Should mainly focus on UI and UX but in an Mobile context. It could be acceptable to use an article that, altough uses Android as the example, is applicable in iOS. Some articles for Web, can also be interesting from an iOS dev point of view
 * **Business** - They help the typical developer to understand how to run his/her business. This could be related to the App store ecosystem, to how-to run your business as an indie dev, etc.
 * **Videos & Slides** - Self explanatory
 * **Indie Apps** - Since it's quite difficult (or expensive) for the typical Indie dev to market his/her app, we reserve this section for those awesome people.
